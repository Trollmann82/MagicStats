Mining Statistics made simple

This currently only works for Gincoin on a few predefined pools (or solo mining!). In the near plans are to rework this to work with a lot more coins and pools by customizable settings.

You can find the lastest compiled stable Windows binary in releases, chances are high that the Python version will be newer.

MagicStats requires Python 3.6 or newer to work. For Linux installation, this will work:

<code>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa/</code>

<code>sudo apt-get update</code>

<code>sudo apt-get install python3.6</code>

Make sure you have the correct Python libraries installed:

<code>pip install requests</code>
  
<code>pip install datetime</code>

To start the script, browse to the directory where you save it and run:

<code>python3.6 ./magicstats.py</code>
