# MagicStats
Mining Statistics made simple

MagicStats requires Python 3.6 or newer to work.

<code>
sudo apt-get install python3.6
</code>

To start the script, browse to the directory where you save it and run:

<code>
python3.6 ./Mining.py
  </code>

For now, use either Mining.py for a rolling list that updates every 5 minutes (this makes it possible to trace back old data),
or v2mining.py for a window that refreshes the screen every 5 minutes (this gives less clutter and a cleaner view, but you can't see old data). Working on how to make this a user option so I can revert to having just one version of the software.
